abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) a tired framework necessitates the use of diverse technologies, for capturing, processing, analyzing, and storing large unprocessed data in cloud-based data centers for the IoTs to function as desired. The security and privacy are some of the critical concerns with increased communication among billons of IoT-connected devices. In this article, an overview of three-layered IoT architecture is provided, and the vulnerabilities and threats in all the three layers have been discussed. It also discusses the security practices that can be enforced in each layer due to limiting functionalities of current hardware technology. The article also explores some of the countermeasures and protection methods such as authentication, authorization, lightweight symmetric, and asymmetric algorithms that can be implemented against various attacks on all the three layers.",
