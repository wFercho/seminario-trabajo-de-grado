abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is the recent and growing which is inevitable in day-to-day activities in current life. IoT is the network of systems which interconnect various real world objects and serve for the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication through the support of Internet. The significant functionality of IoT deals with an enormous amount of data sensed from various heterogeneous IoT devices. The data from various sensors of the objects are collected and converted to information relevant for the application using various machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the business and data analytics algorithms aid in the prediction of events on the basis of observed behavior and information. The routing of information in a secure way with limited resources over Internet in for IoT applications is a significant challenge. This paper is aimed to analyze and explore various research challenges and open issues related to security and use of IoT protocols. The main contribution of the survey is to highlight the research trends and simulation tools used for analysis of IoT layer protocols.}
