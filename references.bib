	ABSTRACT = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has the potential to improve the production and business processes by enabling the extraction of valuable information from industrial processes. The mining industry, however, is rather traditional and somewhat slow to change due to infrastructural limitations in communication, data management, storage, and exchange of information. Most research efforts so far on applying IIoT in the mining industry focus on specific concerns such as ventilation monitoring, accident analysis, fleet and personnel management, tailing dam monitoring, and pre-alarm system while an overall IIoT architecture suitable for the general conditions in the mining industry is still missing. This article analyzes the current state of Information Technology in the mining sector and identifies a major challenge of vertical fragmentation due to the technological variety of various systems and devices offered by different vendors, preventing interoperability, data distribution, and the exchange of information securely between devices and systems. Based on guidelines and practices from the major IIoT standards, a high-level IIoT architecture suitable for the mining industry is then synthesized and presented, addressing the identified challenges and enabling smart mines by automation, interoperable systems, data distribution, and real-time visibility of the mining status. Remote controlling, data processing, and interoperability techniques of the architecture evolve all stages of mining from prospecting to reclamation. The adoption of such IIoT architecture in the mining industry offers safer mine site for workers, predictable mining operations, interoperable environment for both traditional and modern systems and devices, automation to reduce human intervention, and enables underground surveillance by converging operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT). Significant open research challenges and directions are also studied and identified in this paper, such as mobility management, scalability, virtualization at the IIoT edge, and digital twins.},

	ABSTRACT = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a technology for monitoring and controlling distributed processes. SCADA provides real-time data exchange between a control/monitoring centre and field devices connected to the distributed processes. A SCADA system performs these functions using its four basic elements: Field Instrumentation Devices (FIDs) such as sensors and actuators which are connected to the distributed process plants being managed, Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) such as single board computers for receiving, processing and sending the remote data from the field instrumentation devices, Master Terminal Units (MTUs) for handling data processing and human machine interactions, and lastly SCADA Communication Channels for connecting the RTUs to the MTUs, and for parsing the acquired data. Generally, there are two classes of SCADA hardware and software; Proprietary (Commercial) and Open Source. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a low-cost, Open Source SCADA system by using Thinger.IO local server IoT platform as the MTU and ESP32 Thing micro-controller as the RTU. SCADA architectures have evolved over the years from monolithic (stand-alone) through distributed and networked architectures to the latest Internet of Things (IoT) architecture. The SCADA system proposed in this work is based on the Internet of Things SCADA architecture which incorporates web services with the conventional (traditional) SCADA for a more robust supervisory control and monitoring. It comprises of analog Current and Voltage Sensors, the low-power ESP32 Thing micro-controller, a Raspberry Pi micro-controller, and a local Wi-Fi Router. In its implementation, the current and voltage sensors acquire the desired data from the process plant, the ESP32 micro-controller receives, processes and sends the acquired sensor data via a Wi-Fi network to the Thinger.IO local server IoT platform for data storage, real-time monitoring and remote control. The Thinger.IO server is locally hosted by the Raspberry Pi micro-controller, while the Wi-Fi network which forms the SCADA communication channel is created using the Wi-Fi Router. In order to test the proposed SCADA system solution, the designed hardware was set up to remotely monitor the Photovoltaic (PV) voltage, current, and power, as well as the storage battery voltage of a 260 W, 12 V Solar PV System. Some of the created Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) on Thinger.IO Server where an operator can remotely monitor the data in the cloud, as well as initiate supervisory control activities if the acquired data are not in the expected range, using both a computer connected to the network, and Thinger.IO Mobile Apps are presented in the paper.},

SCADA systems have become an essential part of automated control and monitoring of Critical Infrastructures (CI). Modern SCADA systems have evolved from standalone systems into sophisticated, complex, open systems connected to the Internet. This geographically distributed modern SCADA system is more vulnerable to threats and cyber attacks than traditional SCADA. Traditional SCADA systems were less exposed to Internet threats as they operated on isolated networks. Over the years, an increase in the number of cyber-attacks against the SCADA systems seeks security researchers’ attention towards their security. In this review paper, we first review the SCADA system architectures and comparative analysis of proposed/implemented communication protocols, followed by attacks on such systems to understand and highlight the evolving security needs for SCADA systems. A short investigation of the current state of intrusion detection techniques in SCADA systems is done, followed by a brief study of testbeds for SCADA systems. The cloud and Internet of things (IoT) based SCADA systems are studied by analyzing modern SCADA systems’ architecture. In the end, the review paper highlights the critical research problems that need to be resolved to close the security gaps in SCADA systems.}

	ABSTRACT = {Since the smart grid deals with a large mass of data and critical missions, it requires ubiquitous, reliable, and real-time communication. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which has the potential of connecting all objects over the globe through the Internet, excels in providing robust information transmission infrastructure in the smart grid. There are a multitude of possible protocols, standards, and configurations for communication in the smart grid. A commonly applied communication standard IEC 61850 recommends the use of Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) protocol for communication in Local Area Network (LAN) and eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) in Wide Area Network (WAN). However, a plethora of research on this topic compares the behavior of other IoT protocols and standard recommendations in the smart grid. On the other hand, the sky-rocketing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), especially in the form of micro grid, transformed the central control structure of the smart grid into a distributed style called Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). This new approach defined new communication requirements and more particular IoT protocol characteristic requirements. However, a limited number of the existing studies have considered IoT protocol characteristic requirements of the smart grid and its new control structures. In this paper, we initially investigate the communication requirements of the smart grid and introduce all IoT protocols and their specifications. We analyze IoT protocol characteristics and performances in the smart grid through literature review based on the smart grid communication requirements. In this approach, we highlight weak points of these practices making them fail to acquire the holistic guidelines in utilizing proper IoT protocol that can meet the smart grid environment interaction requirements. Using the existing facilities, the public Internet, we follow the arrangement of cost-effective high penetration communication requirements for new structures of the smart grid, i.e., the MAS and multi-micro grid. In this case, we consider IoT protocol Quality of Services (QoS) requirements, especially in the case of security and reliability, to satisfy stakeholders, namely utilities and prosumers. Addressing effective elements in applying IoT in the smart grid’s future trends is another contribution to this paper.},

In this paper, a prediction model has been proposed for improving the safety and productivity of underground coal mines using a hybrid CNN-LSTM model and IoT-enabled sensors. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model can extract spatial and temporal features from mine data and efficiently predict different mine hazards. The proposed model also improves the flexibility, scalability, and coverage area of a mine monitoring system to an underground mine's remote locations to minimize the loss of miners' lives. The proposed model efficiently predicts miner's health quality index (MHQI) for working faces and gases in goaf areas of mines. The experimental results demonstrated that the predicted mean square error of the proposed model is less than 0.0009 and 0.0025 for MHQI; 0.0011 and 0.0033 for CH4 in comparison with CNN and LSTM models, respectively. The less means square error indicates the better prediction accuracy of the trained. Similarly, the correlation coefficient (R2) value of the proposed model is found greater than 0.005 and 0.001 for MHQI; 0.007 and 0.001 for CH4 compared to CNN and LSTM models, respectively.

	ABSTRACT = {The recent tailings storage facility (TSF) dam failures recorded around the world have concerned society in general, forcing the mining industry to improve its operating standards, invest greater economic resources, and implement the best available technologies (BATs) to control TSFs for safety purposes and avoid spills, accidents, and collapses. In this context, and as the era of digitalization and Industry 4.0 continues, monitoring technologies based on sensors have become increasingly common in the mining industry. This article studies the state of the art of implementing sensor technologies to monitor structural health and safety management issues in TSFs, highlighting advances and experiences through a review of the scientific literature on the topic. The methodology applied in this article adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and utilizes scientific maps for data visualization. To do so, three steps were implemented: (i) a quantitative bibliometric analysis, (ii) a qualitative systematic review of the literature, and (iii) a mixed review to integrate the findings from (i) and (ii). As a result, this article presents the main advances, gaps, and future trends regarding the main characteristics of the sensor technologies applied to monitor TSF structural health and safety management in the era of digitalization. According to the results, the existing research predominantly investigates certain TSF sensor technologies, such as wireless real-time monitoring, remote sensors (RS), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned survey vessels (USVs), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and Internet of Things (IoT) approaches, among others. These technologies stand out for their potential to improve the safety management monitoring of mine tailings, which is particularly significant in the context of climate change-related hazards, and to reduce the risk of TSF failures. They are recognized as emerging smart mining solutions with reliable, simple, scalable, secure, and competitive characteristics.},

	abstract = {Context:
	Applying Microservices Architecture (MSA) in DevOps has received significant attention in recent years. However, there exists no comprehensive review of the state of research on this topic.
	Objective:
	This work aims to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the literature on MSA in DevOps.
	Methods:
	A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) has been conducted on the literature published between January 2009 and July 2018.
	Results:
	Forty-seven studies were finally selected and the key results are: (1) Three themes on the research on MSA in DevOps are “microservices development and operations in DevOps”, “approaches and tool support for MSA based systems in DevOps”, and “MSA migration experiences in DevOps”. (2) 24 problems with their solutions regarding implementing MSA in DevOps are identified. (3) MSA is mainly described by using boxes and lines. (4) Most of the quality attributes are positively affected when employing MSA in DevOps. (5) 50 tools that support building MSA based systems in DevOps are collected. (6) The combination of MSA and DevOps has been applied in a wide range of application domains.
	Conclusion:
	The results and findings will benefit researchers and practitioners to conduct further research and bring more dedicated solutions for the issues of MSA in DevOps.}

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) redefines the way how commodity and industrial tasks are performed every day. The integration of sensors, lightweight computation, and the proliferation of different wireless technologies on IoT platforms enable human beings to easily interact with their surrounding physical world thoroughly. With the recent rise of IoT, several different IoT platforms have been introduced for researchers and developers to ease the management and control of various IoT devices. In general, the IoT platforms act as a bridge between core IoT functionalities and users by providing APIs. Due to their wide variety of applications, IoT platforms are mostly unique in their architectures and designs. Thus, IoT administrators, developers, and researchers (i.e., IoT users) are challenged with substantial configuration differences in the proper configuration, implementation, and protection of the IoT solutions. In this survey, we conduct an in-depth analysis of popular IoT platforms from different application domains. More specifically, we define a comprehensive evaluation framework that considers seven different technical comparison criteria: (1) topology design, (2) programming languages, (3) third-party support, (4) extended protocol support, (5) event handling, (6) security, and (7) privacy. Then, we use the framework to evaluate the different IoT platforms highlighting their distinguishing attributes on communications, security, and privacy. First, we describe the communication protocols supported by the different IoT platforms surveyed. Then, rather than uncovering novel threats affecting IoT, we aim to analyze how the different IoT platforms handle security and privacy vulnerabilities affecting the most common security services of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and access control. Further, we present possible solutions that these platforms could implement to strengthen security and privacy within the IoT solution. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of every IoT platform, so IoT administrators, developers, and researchers (i.e., IoT users) can make an informed decision on the use of specific platforms to implement their IoT solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to evaluate different IoT platforms using the criteria defined in this work.}

	abstract = {Predictive maintenance, quality management, and zero-defect manufacturing are among the most prominent smart manufacturing use cases in the Industry4.0 era. Nevertheless, the development of such systems is still challenging because of the need to integrate multiple fragmented data sources, to apply advanced machine learning techniques for multi-objective optimizations, and to implement configurable digital twins that can flexibly adapt to changing industrial configurations. This paper presents the architecture, design, practical implementation, and evaluation of an end-to-end platform that addresses these challenges. The platform provides the means for collecting, managing, and routing data streams from heterogeneous cyber physical production systems, in configurable and interoperable ways. Moreover, it supports advanced data analytics by means of a novel machine learning framework that leverages quantitative rule mining. The presented platform has been successfully deployed in various industrial settings and has been positively evaluated in terms of its ability to accelerate application development, reduce unscheduled downtimes, provide increased Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE), compute production process parameter configurations that lower the percentage of product defects, and predict product defects before they occur.}
